| 1 | Online Deep Learning: Learning Deep Neural Networks on the fly | Doyen Sahoo, Quang Pham, Jing Lu, Steven C.H. Hoi | This paper introduces a novel algorithm, namely Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) for training Deep Neural Networks on the Fly. They put a limit on the number of hidden layers in the network, and use as few as possible hidden layers to improve training performance as well as training time. This method can be viewd as an ensemble of deep neural networks with different depths, since they use a trainable parameter (alpha) to combine outputs of hidden layers in order to obtain final output. Experiments show that in concept drift scenarios this method can quickly adopt changes in comparison to baseline methods. | 2017 | 23 |
